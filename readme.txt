AJAX JQUERY FORM PLUGIN

The Form Plugin supports use of XMLHttpRequest Level 2 and FormData objects on browsers that support these features. As of today (March 2012) that includes Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. On these browsers (and future Opera and IE10) files uploads will occur seamlessly through the XHR object and progress updates are available as the upload proceeds. For older browsers, a fallback technology is used which involves iframes.
